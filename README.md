# Dungeon Finder
Simple mod to locate possible locations of dungeons by putting an end rod at their locations. Intended as a help for development of a future standalone tool.

DO NOT USE ON YOUR ACTUAL WORLD, you will have to regenerate any chunks generated when using this mod as it causes the generation of a lot of flying end rods. Just use it on a copy of your world.
