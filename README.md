# Dungeon Finder
Simple mod to locate possible locations of dungeons by putting an end rod at their locations. Intended as a help for development of a future standalone tool.

Requires Fabric API >= 0.87.0 (will be removed in the future as it isnt really needed)

DO NOT USE ON YOUR ACTUAL WORLD, you will have to regenerate any chunks generated when using this mod as it causes the generation of a lot of flying end rods. Just use it on a copy of your world.
