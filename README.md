# Dungeon Finder
Simple mod to locate possible locations of dungeons by putting an end rod at their locations. Intended as a help for development of a future standalone tool.

Made for minecraft version 1.19.4, fabric loader version 0.14.22 as well as fabric api version 0.87.0+1.19.4 (not actually used in the mod, will be removed later)
